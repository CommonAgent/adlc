// The agent's own files, their structure written from the spec by code.
//
// In the round trip on hn-reader (2026-11-09) the spec was carried across
// exactly and its revisions were exact edits, but the Design was a fresh
// model draft every time: asked to rename one output, it renamed the
// offering, its step and its skill folder too; asked to undo that, it also
// flipped the output's name back. The build could never pass, because the
// agent's files disagreed with the spec. So from 0.10.0 three rules hold:
//
//   1. code copies facts, and the model only describes. Every structural
//      field of the files is written here from the spec, never by the model:
//      the offering ids, step ids and skill folder names (from the spec's
//      declarations when it keeps them, else from its features' offerings),
//      each input's and output's name, kind and schema (declarations, else
//      the spec's pieces and file interfaces), the labels the spec keeps, the
//      run-config settings (the spec's settings), the systems and their
//      address settings (the spec's systems, and each model system the
//      architecture record names; an address only in a setting's
//      default), each run command in the packaged form {home}/{package}/
//      skills/<slug>/scripts/... with the flags its command interface keeps,
//      the scripts, the runtimes, the records and the price. The model writes
//      only the prose: what the agent and each job does, when each is the
//      right one, what a good result is, what happens when there is nothing
//      to give, each job's instructions, each piece's about, each system's
//      needs and the refusals;
//   2. code checks the files against the stage before: every declaration the
//      spec keeps is at its place in the files with its value
//      (declared.mjs), and the package maker's own check runs as before;
//   3. a change is an edit. A revision recomputes the structure from the
//      spec, so it changes only when the spec does; the prose changes only
//      where the person's words name it, and every other prose field stays
//      byte for byte, checked here (proseUnchangedProblems).
//
//   needs: node >= 22. Nothing here reads or writes a file.
