// The answers a build has already settled.
//
// A request can come from somebody who already holds an answer the architect
// would otherwise ask: a build with defaults it settles for every agent it
// makes, the platform's own spending rules, the account's limits. Asking the
// person again is a question nobody needed, and an answer that contradicts
// the build is one the next stage cannot use (technical debt 641: Build an
// agent settles that a person's agent reaches a model only through
// AgentMesh's model door, and the record bound text-reasoning to the House
// Stack, which the Design would then have declared).
//
// So each settled answer is used, as a decision that says where it came
// from, and the question it answers is not asked. Where the architect, or the
// model inside it, would have chosen otherwise, that is said in the
// decision's "weighed", as a note and never as a binding or a question. It
// still asks what nobody else can answer.
//
// The answers travel as exact typed data the scripts read:
//
//   {"settled_answers": "v1", "by": "AgentMesh Build an agent",
//    "answers": [{"key": "...", "answer": "...", "from": "...", "why": "..."}]}
//
// The keys this record has a place for:
//
//   kind          one of the four kinds of agent
//   reaches       nothing-outside-agentmesh: no system outside AgentMesh and
//                 no destination beyond the derived set
//   model         model-door: a model only through AgentMesh's model door, so
//                 no model system is named or bound
//   limit-cost    the spending limit, in words, from whoever holds it
//   attended      no: nobody attends a job, so nobody reviews in between
//   environments  the environments it runs in, a list
//
// Any other key is kept in the records and changes nothing.
//
//   needs: node >= 22. Pure: nothing here reads a file or the network.
