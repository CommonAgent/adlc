// Every job leaves its own records, in a folder of its own.
// Written by the test writer into every suite it writes, the same bytes each
// time; it is the test writer's file and not the package's, so it is never
// edited here. The next suite the test writer writes for this package brings
// its current copy.
//   node --test test/records-per-job.test.mjs
//
// What is worth pinning. The host hands every job of an agent the same
// records folder, the agent's own (RECORDS, or --records), and keeps it from
// one job to the next. A record the declaration keeps per job has a `file`
// pattern whose first part is the job's folder, such as `*/went-without.json`,
// read relative to that records folder (Common Agent 12.4, records[].file).
// So each job writes it under a folder of its own named after its job folder:
// <records>/<the job folder's name>/went-without.json, which a script makes
// as join(RECORDS, basename(JOB_DIR)). A script that writes it straight into
// the records folder overwrites the last job's record with every job, and the
// conformance check's records audit, which reads the same pattern, finds
// nothing there (technical debt 639).
//
// How it is reached. The suite's other tests run two jobs of the same kind,
// each with its own job folder and both with the same records folder, and
// then assert checkRecordsPerJob(records, [jobDir1, jobDir2]) returns no
// problems. A record the declaration says is written only in some cases, and
// that neither job writes, is named in `except` by its name or its file;
// went-without.json never is, since every job writes it, with no entries when
// it lacked nothing, and the conformance check reads it after jobs that may
// lack nothing (build ab_3508d5dec3d4642113 did not conform for that). This
// file's own tests check the checker; they run only when this file is run
// itself, so importing checkRecordsPerJob from it adds none.
//
// Nothing here touches a network, a model or a host.
