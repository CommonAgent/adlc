// Answer each dependent: compatible, breaking, or a change of behavior, with
// where it was learned of and why.
//
// What a dependent uses decides which differences reach it:
//   - a solution whose canvas was given: the lines out of the changed agent's
//     box (which outputs it reads, and the input of the next box each one
//     goes into, with that input's kind) and the lines into it (which inputs
//     it sends);
//   - an agent given as one that may take what the changed agent hands back:
//     each of its inputs with the name of one of the agent's outputs, or
//     failing that with exactly the kind of one, before or after;
//   - anything else (another organization's solution, whose canvas its owner
//     does not show, a schedule, a caller seen only in the record of who
//     called it): the offerings the platform saw it use, or every offering
//     when it saw none, and what it reads is not known.
//
// An output whose kind changed is answered for each reader by the platform's
// own rule for whether a line fits (kinds.mjs, from ports.ts):
//   the new kind fits the reader's input and the old one did   change of behavior
//     (the line still fits, but what arrives is labelled differently, and only
//     a run of the new version shows whether the reader reads it the same);
//   the new kind fits and the old one did not                  compatible
//   the old kind fitted and the new one does not               breaking
//   the reader's input is not known, and the new kind is a
//     narrower spelling of the old one, so every input that
//     took the old kind takes the new one                      change of behavior
//   anything else                                              breaking, because
//     it could not be told.
//
// The worst answer a dependent gets is its answer: breaking, then change of
// behavior, then compatible. The same inputs always give the same answers, in
// the same order.
