// Bind each system in each environment: the organization's stack first, the
// House Stack for the rest, and a question wherever neither may stand.
//
// No judgment here, and no model. The role says what a binding is (Agent
// Roles, the solution architect: "the organization's own choice is the
// binding wherever it made one, a platform default fills each binding it left
// open"), walked in the order the deploy's own resolver uses (AgentMesh
// services/src/api/stack.ts, resolveSystem):
//
//   1. the organization's own binding for that environment;
//   2. its production binding, where the environment has none and the
//      organization said production may stand in;
//   3. the House Stack's product, where the House Stack covers the system,
//      marked as a platform default: the role's "a platform default fills
//      each binding it left open" (Agent Roles, the solution architect);
//   4. otherwise a question naming the system and the environment.
//
// One place the role and the deploy disagree, and it is said rather than
// hidden: the deploy's resolver refuses a test or production deploy for a
// system the organization bound in another environment and not that one
// (docs/account-stack.md, section 3, step 7), where the role fills it with a
// default. The record follows the role, and that binding's decision says that
// a deploy there needs the organization's own binding first, so nobody learns
// it at the approval.
//
// A binding names a product and says who provides it. It never carries the
// credential, the address, the settings or the key store the stack holds:
// those are what an install needs, and the owner's instruction supplies them.
